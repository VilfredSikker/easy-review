# PR ref resolution (all ER skills)

Pass the user's target as **`ref`** on any PR-scoped MCP tool, or call **`pr_resolve`** first.

## Accepted `ref` forms

| User types | Example | Resolves via |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| PR URL | `https://github.com/o/r/pull/42` | URL parse |
| Worktree path | `/Users/me/Projects/foo` | git toplevel → open PR for current branch |
| `owner/repo#N` | `acme/widgets#42` | Explicit PR number |
| `owner/repo` | `vilfred/ai-report-builder` | ER project with that remote → open PR in that checkout |
| Branch name | `feature/auth` | `gh pr list --head` in project/cwd repo |
| Bare number | `42` | Active ER project or `repo=` |

## Skill workflow

1. If the user gave a ref (URL, path, slug, branch, number), pass it as `ref` on the tool call.
2. If ambiguous, call **`pr_resolve`** once and use the returned `repo`, `number`, `pr_url`, `bucket_path`.
3. Do not guess a different PR than `pr_resolve` returns.

## Examples

```text
er-review https://github.com/acme/widgets/pull/42
er-review /Users/me/Projects/Discovery/discovery
er-review vilfred/ai-report-builder
er-get-feedback feature/my-branch
```

## Errors

- **No open PR for branch** — ask for a PR URL or `owner/repo#N`.
- **No ER project for owner/repo** — pass a worktree path or configure the project in Desktop.
- **No PR on current branch** — checkout the PR branch or pass an explicit URL.
